# AcrControls - Custom WinForms Controls

**AcrControls** is a lightweight library of customizable Windows Forms controls built for modern .NET applications.

Developed by **Arthur Cabral**, this package aims to improve user experience and developer productivity by providing enhanced versions of native controls like `TextBox`, `ComboBox`, and more.

Currently, only the custom `TextBox` is available — but more controls will be added soon.

## ✨ Features

- Custom styling for controls (e.g., focus/blur color effects)
- Clean tab navigation (Enter to Tab)
- Easy integration into any .NET WinForms project
- Extensible design — more controls to come

## 📦 Installation

Via NuGet Package Manager:

```sh
Install-Package AcrControls
